This project investigates a comparative analysis of CNN models for accurate gender and age prediction from facial images, aiming to assess the robustness of various convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures. The study focuses on overcoming challenges related to diverse datasets and unfiltered facial images. The UTKFace dataset, consisting of 23,708 annotated facial images with various attributes such as age, gender, and ethnicity, serves as the basis for this exploration. Leveraging the richness of the dataset, the project strives to comprehensively evaluate the performance of CNN models in age and gender prediction.Using advanced deep learning techniques, the study presents different CNN architectures, including Xception, VGG16, ResNet152V2, InceptionResNetV2, MobileNetV2, DenseNet201, NASNetLarge, EfficientNetB7, EfficientNetV2L, and ConvNeXtXLarge. These models are selected based on their Top-1 Accuracy values for gender and age prediction, forming the foundation for a comparative analysis. The performance evaluation of these models involves the use of various metrics. For gender classification, binary-cross entropy is used, while mean absolute error (MAE) is chosen for age regression. Examining loss curves during training and validation, along with accuracy metrics, provides valuable insights into the convergence and generalization capabilities of the models.The main findings reveal that, despite achieving commendable accuracy in gender prediction, variations persist in age predictions among the models. This observation underscores the nuanced nature of age prediction, influenced by various factors affecting facial appearance.The comparative analysis emphasizes that each model has unique strengths and weaknesses, notably Xception, VGG16, ResNet152V2, InceptionResNetV2, DenseNet201, NASNetLarge, and ConvNeXtXLarge, demonstrating robust performance in gender classification and consistent age predictions.The implications of accurate age and gender prediction from facial images extend to various industries, including retail, entertainment, healthcare, security, and law enforcement. The study highlights the potential for personalized services, content curation, and enhanced surveillance systems.As the research concludes, recommendations emerge for further exploration, including model fine-tuning, assessing improvements with additional training, and considering unfiltered facial images. The study emphasizes the importance of evaluating different CNN architectures for optimal performance in age and gender prediction tasks. In terms of contributions to knowledge, this research adds value by conducting a comprehensive evaluation of multiple CNN architectures on a diverse dataset, addressing gaps in existing literature, and providing nuanced insights into the applicability of different CNN models for age and gender prediction from unfiltered facial images. Looking forward, future research directions involve exploring opportunities for model fine-tuning, acquiring additional training data, and investigating ensemble approaches for combining predictions. The study encourages ongoing exploration of advanced modeling techniques and the inclusion of additional variables for further refinement in facial image analysis.
